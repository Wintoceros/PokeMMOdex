# PokeMMOdex
Make the PokéMMO dex available offline.

## Cache
This is the offline data that the program uses.
It is a modified version of [pokeapi.co](https://pokeapi.co) adapted to PokeMMO as of 2018-02-01 (last changelog: **2017-30-12**).

I will not publish the cache on Github, as it is several **hundreds** of MB.  
Contact me for a dl link.
